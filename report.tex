\section{Introduction}
Boltzmann machines are a thing. But they are slow. Sparsifying them makes them not crap. Using networks of cool kids (or models of networks of cool kids) means that we also gain resilience against random attack, which sounds for defs like a cool kids thing. Taking advantage of this sparsification to make learning a lot faster, we see if we can get a language model which is also cool kids. Scale-freedom of the coolness sounds also appropriate to mention, and yadda yadda Zipf's statistical law.
